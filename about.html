      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Lumix.INC was founded to address a problem we saw in the digital creative space:  
        high-quality AI tools were either locked behind expensive subscriptions or required  
        powerful devices to run. We wanted to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is simple: <strong>AI-powered creativity should be for everyone.</strong>  
        Whether you're an artist seeking inspiration, a business owner needing marketing visuals,  
        or a student creating a project, Lumix provides powerful AI tools that are accessible,  
        fast, and easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, Lumix has evolved into a <strong>full AI creativity platform</strong> that supports  
        various models, real-time previews, and upcoming mobile access to make creativity truly mobile.
      </p>

        from anywhere. Designed for speed and convenience, it will include:
